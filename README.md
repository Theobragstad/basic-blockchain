Interface for a simple blockchain-based cryptocurrency  

This project provides the infrastructure and interface for a basic blockchain-based cryptocurrency that implements the core features/concepts of a real blockchain that can be added to, mined, checked for validity, and more  

It uses SHA-256 for hashing and nonce values for mining, along with a variety of data structures that are useful in the creation and maintenance of a blockchain
